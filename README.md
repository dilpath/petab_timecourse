# PEtab timecourse
This is an example implementation of an extension of PEtab, for the specification of time-dependent conditions.

# Installation
Clone this repository then install it into your Python (virtual) environment.
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dilpath/petab_timecourse
cd petab_timecourse
pip install -e .[examples]
```

# Examples
The examples depend on [AMICI](https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI) for simulation and [pyPESTO](https://github.com/ICB-DCM/pyPESTO) for optimization, but these are independent of the PEtab extension.
